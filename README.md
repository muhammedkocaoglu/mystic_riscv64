# mystic_riscv64
64-bit RISC-V processor  <br/>

The project is implemented for the TEKNOFEST Chip Design Contest held every year in Turkey. RISC-V <br/>
processor core and UART, SPI peripherals are all designed from the ground up. The core supports <br/>
I(Integer), M(Multiply-divide), C(Compressed), and 6 other special instructions. The complete SoC can run at <br/>
100 MHz in Artix-7 FPGA and is tested on the Arty A7 35T FPGA board. <br/>
